      <h1>AN <span class="highlight">OP</span> THEME JUST FOR <span class="highlight">GAMERS</span></h1>
      <p>We built Gameucated to prove one thing — gaming isn’t just play. It’s strategy, teamwork, discipline, and growth. Every clutch, every comeback, every round — it teaches something that applies beyond the screen.</p>

  <!-- WHO WE ARE -->
  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>WHO <span class="highlight">WE ARE</span></h2>
    <p>Gameucated started with a single idea — to fuse gaming and education into something revolutionary. Our founders, lifelong gamers and educators, saw how the focus, decision-making, and reflexes learned in games translate directly to real-life success. We wanted to create a space where players could grow not only as competitors but as thinkers, leaders, and innovators.</p>
    <p>From FPS to MOBA, our team studies how games sharpen the mind. Every course we design pushes players to improve mentally, strategically, and emotionally — transforming entertainment into empowerment.</p>

        <h2>OUR <span class="highlight">MISSION</span></h2>
        <p>To make learning as engaging as gaming. We aim to redefine how the world sees education — not as something boring, but as something exciting, competitive, and worth grinding for. Gameucated.gg is where learning feels like leveling up.</p>

      <div class="motto-text">
        <h2>OUR <span class="highlight">MOTTO</span></h2>
        <h3 class="motto">GAME YOUR WAY TO KNOWLEDGE</h3>
        <p>Every click, every strategy, every moment in-game teaches something. We exist to harness that — to turn players into achievers, and achievers into champions both online and offline.</p>
